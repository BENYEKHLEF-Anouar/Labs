 Preline UI is a Tailwind CSS-based component library, so Tailwind must be installed (it is by default in new Laravel 12 projects). You'll need Node.js and npm.
 

 * 01 - Install Preline UI via npm:
 npm install preline

 * 02 - Import Preline's variants and source in your CSS entry point (resources/css/app.css).

 * 03 - Import Preline JavaScript in resources/js/app.js and auto-initialize components.

 * 04 - Use the @vite directive in Blade templates to load assets.

 * 05 - Run npm run dev for development and test components from Preline's docs.
